# Summer-Internship_1--NLP
This project, focuses on building a robust text preprocessing pipeline as an essential foundation for  NLP tasks. The project specifically addresses the cleaning and preparation of raw Twitter sentiment data, with the goal of making it suitable for advanced analyses like sentiment classification and other NLP-driven applications.

Key objectives:

Text Cleaning: Remove punctuation, URLs, HTML tags, and noisy characters.

Normalization & Tokenization: Convert text to lowercase and split into tokens for easier processing.

Word Analysis: Exclude stopwords, frequent, and rare words to focus on meaningful text.

Stemming & Lemmatization: Reduce words to roots and canonical forms for consistency.

Spelling Correction & POS Tagging: Apply spelling correction and identify grammatical roles to enhance text accuracy.

Data Preparation: Perform shuffling to minimize ordering bias.
The outcome is a fully cleaned, standardized, and high-quality textual dataset, ready for building reliable NLP models. The project demonstrates the critical impact text preprocessing has on the performance and accuracy of downstream NLP applications.

# Team 12 NLP Project: Text Cleaning and Preprocessing Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline designed to clean, normalize, and prepare raw textual data (specifically, Twitter sentiment data) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The processed data serves as the input for training models in sentiment analysis and other NLP-based applications.

## Features

- **Normalization:** Converts all text to lowercase for uniformity.
- **Noise Removal:** Eliminates punctuation, URLs, HTML tags, and special characters.
- **Stopword Filtering:** Removes common words lacking semantic value.
- **Word Frequency Analysis:** Detects and removes excessively frequent and rare words.
- **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Reduces words to root and dictionary forms.
- **Spelling Correction:** Identifies and corrects misspellings.
- **POS Tagging:** Tags words by their grammatical roles.
- **Random Shuffling:** Ensures unbiased data distribution.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Required Libraries**
    - pandas
    - nltk
    - pyspellchecker
    - re (regular expression)
2. **Clone the Repository**
    - `git clone <repo-link>`
3. **Load the Dataset**
    - Place your dataset (e.g., Twitter sentiment data) into the project directory.
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**
    - Follow steps in the provided `.ipynb` notebooks:
        - Tokenization and sentence splitting
        - Noise removal and normalization
        - Stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging
        - Data cleaning functions and example usage

## Example Usage
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from spellchecker import SpellChecker

text = "Hppy to lern NLP! Visit https://github.com"
tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
spell = SpellChecker()
corrected = [spell.correction(w) for w in tokens]
print("Corrected Tokens:", corrected)
